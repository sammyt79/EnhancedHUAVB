.NET1 week3

This was my second individual assignment for .NET I.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Design, implement, test, and debug a Visual BasicÂ® program to create an enhanced home utility auditing program based on Week Two.
 
The user should be able to do the following:
Enter the cost per kilowatt-hour
Select a home appliance from a list of home appliances (minimum of 6 appliances). Use the combo-box.  The six appliances must be (at a minimum):
Stereo
Dish Washer
Lava Lamp
Microwave
Gamma Blaster
TV
Enter the power needed in kilowatts (kW) for the selected appliance (average power used per hour for this device)
Enter the average number of hours used per day for the selected appliance.
If the Dish Washer or other appliance that requires water is selected, the user must enter the following:
The number of gallons of water used by the dishwasher per hour
The cost per gallon (valid range is .1 to 5 cents per gallon)
If dishwasher is not selected, these two fields must be disabled so the user will not be able to update them.
 
The program must do the following:
 
Validate that the data entered has the correct format, and is within a reasonable range (see Week 2 requirements)
Have an "Exit" button that will end the program.
Have a "Clear" button that will clear all input fields, but will not affect the datagridview control or the running total.
Have a single "Calculate" button that will calculate and display the cost for operating the selected home appliance per hour and annual cost. If Dishwasher is selected, make sure you include the additional cost of water.  This button will also add a new record in the datagridview detailed below.
Create a listing area that is part of the data entry form that has a datagridview control to display data as each appliance is entered. The information displayed must include:
Appliance selected
Number of hours per day appliance is used
Cost per hour for selected appliance (include water if applicable)
Annual cost for operating the appliance
Within the listing area you must also display and update the total annual cost of all appliances, as soon as a new entry is added to the listing area. This is your running total. It can be a field underneath the datagridview control. Make sure the user cannot edit this field.
 
Write the code for the program and test the results.
 
Your name, date, project description and class must be in the code as comments (similar to an APA title page). This must be in the form that automatically loads when the program is executed.
 
Your project must be properly documented (describe the use of variables, describe how a function or routine works, use proper naming conventions for variables and labels).
